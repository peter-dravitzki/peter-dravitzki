### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate and driven Web Developer/Data Analyst. I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript SQL, Python, and frameworks including React and Node.js.

Having spent time at Dev Academy completing the Certificate in Applied Software Development I gained experience working in an Agile environment. My roles in different projects included Backend Lead, Frontend Lead, and Git Lead. I was most comfortable in the Backend Lead role.

Being self-improvement driven I actively seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge. Whether building responsive and visually appealing websites, delving into the intricacies of backend development, or visualizing a complex and messy dataset, I approach each project with creativity and analytical thinking.

As I embark on my journey to secure my next job in tech, I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for web development to contribute meaningfully to a dynamic and innovative team.
